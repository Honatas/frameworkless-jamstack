Proof of concept - you can create SPA frontends without a Virtual DOM framework (Angular, React, etc).

## But Why ?

Most of the time, all web applications we are making are actually master-detail pages for CRUDs, not home brokers. Data doesn't change in real-time and you don't need "blazing fast" rendering, just normal DOM speed is more than enough. Data binding and Virtual DOM rendering are overkill in these cases, taking up machine resources (memory, cpu) you'll not exactly take advantage of.  

## So what, get back to old-times vanilla ?

Of course not. Typescript is here to stay. Also, the concept of SPA (Single Page Applications) and having a bundled single javascript file are too good to be left aside. So the proposal here is to get all of these without resorting to any overcomplex Virtual DOM framework.  

## Then how ?

Soon... (work in progress)
